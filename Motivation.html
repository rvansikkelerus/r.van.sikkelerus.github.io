        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s
        when a n unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
        type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. It is a long
        established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of
        a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it
        has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
        desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
        their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
        web sites still in their infancy.

      <div class="scroll"> <h1> Theorie </h1>
        Find out what motivation exactly is and which types of motivation exist. Search for a minimum of three sources. Add the sources to your resource list.
        On your motivation page, create a chapter called ‘Theory’. On that page, write a piece of text based on your research about motivation (what is it? Which types exist?).
         Use formal written language like “According to + name of the author/title of the article etc…” and “…name of the author/title of the article etc. + states/poses/claims/argues…” Always add the references to the sources according to the APA format.
         
         Add your notes to the chapter about theory on your motivation page (max. ¼ A4). Do not forget to copy the link to the TED talk in your resource list (you must always name the sources that you use, so get used to it).
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="scroll"> <h1> Performance motivation </h1>
        In your work add a chapter called ‘Performance motivation’ (for the resource list). Copy the results in that chapter.
         Then, summarize this by minimally highlighting the four most important statements (bold, underlined, italics or similar).

      
        In addition, describe in about three sentences whether you agree or disagree with the results of the test and why.
        Search for minimally two examples in the feedback of the application assignment that support your agreement or disagreement. 
        Use each example and make the reader understand why these particular examples back up your argumentation.
        You could also refer to other examples from your personal experience: previous education, side job, sports (and how you prepared for it). 
        In your writing use as many terms as possible that you have defined in the theory.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="scroll"> <h1> Career anchors/values</h1>
        Add a new chapter ‘Career anchors/values’ to your motivation page (for the resource list).

        First, take the two most important anchors / values.

        After that, search with each anchor for an example from your own experience. 
        Describe each example and motivate why you think it is suitable. 
        In your description use as many of the terms possible that you defined in the theory.

        Finally, take the least important anchor and describe an example in a similar way.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="scroll"> <h1> Resource List</h1>
        Add a chapter called ‘Resource list’ to the page. Resource lists are important in order to give credit to your content. When needed, the reader can check your facts and as a result be convinced of your conclusions. 
        The resource list is usually located at the end of a document (see Wikipedia, for example). So, make sure to insert all ensuing chapters before the resource list.

        Referring to a source in a resource list and quoting sources is preferably done by means of a standard format. At the HZ we use the APA format. You should apply it here too; practice makes perfect. Tip: there are websites that offer help with the APA format.
        
        You must also apply the feedback from the job application assignment (PCO1) to the other assignments. These should therefore be added to the resource list. So, scan the filled-in documents. 
        Use the PDF file format. After that, copy the documents to the source files of your website in order to be able to add a link on your website. Finally, add the links to the resource list. Do not forget to test everything.
